## 20 is a magic number.

20, two decades. If when you was over 18 and you didn't wanna face the truth that you are not young any more, you could still say "Well, I'm still eighTEEN or I'm still nineTEEN". Well, now, you cannot play this little trick any more.

This year's meant to be an important year for me. Not only because my little trick doesn't work any more(Well, that's a big reason:P), but also because of Kobe's farewell. 

"With the 13th pick in the 1996 NBA draft, the Charlotte Hornets select Kobe Bryant from Lower Marion high school.", Kobe Bryant, one of the greatest players in NBA history as well as the player I respect most, retired after playing for L.A. Lakers for 20 years. Leaving a legendary 60 points in his last game.

## It was the end of a decase, but the start of an age.

It's the day when I found 20 years have got behind me. The future is still unpredictable. But living a life which has been carefully designed is also tedious, isn't it?

Still have a taste for snow and being alone. Social Barriers maybe...

Hope one day, I'll live in somewhere like this:

Guess where is it? Norway or Iceland or Greenland?

## Good times, bad time, you know I've had a share.

Well, that's it.
